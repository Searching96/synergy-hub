| **API Gateway**          | Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, or Traefik  | Routing, API security, rate limiting             |
| **Database (Relational)**| MySQL, PostgreSQL                              | User, project, and transactional data            |
| **Database (NoSQL/Cache)**| MongoDB, Redis                         | Unstructured data, caching tasks/sessions        |
| **Web Frontend**         | React (w/ TypeScript) **or** Angular    | Single Page Application; choose for main module  |
| **UI/Design Framework**  | Material-UI (React) / Angular Material / Ant Design | Unified look & feel                |
| **Styling**              | TailwindCSS, SASS/SCSS                  | Rapid theming and custom CSS                     |
| **DevOps & CI/CD**       | Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jenkins | Containerization and pipeline automation    |
| **Monitoring/Logging**   | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK (Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana) | Metrics, logs, dashboards      |
| **API Documentation**    | OpenAPI/Swagger, Redoc                  | Autogenerated, interactive docs for all APIs     |
| **Code Quality**         | ESLint/Prettier (JS/TS), Checkstyle/Spotless (Java), golangci-lint (Go) | Consistent code style, linting      |
| **Version Control**      | Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)      | Collaboration and code integration               |
| **Local Environment**    | Docker Compose, .env configs            | Multi-service local dev, env management          |
| **Branching Strategy**   | `main`, `dev`, feature branches         | Organized, reliable collaborative workflow       |

**Notes:**
- Choose either **React TypeScript or Angular** as the main frontend for Phase 0; keep both in mind if planning multiple frontends later.
- Docker/Kubernetes setup and initial docs are strongly recommended in Phase 0 for reliable scaling.
- Begin with OpenAPI specs and CI/CD from the start for robust, team-friendly development.

This table ensures your foundational phase is modern, scalable, secure, and ready for rapid future expansion.
